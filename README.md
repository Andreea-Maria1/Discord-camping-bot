# Discord-camping-bot

This is a starter project for a discord bot. 
I am a big fan of hiking and nature but when making a server for my friends and I to go hike, there were no camping discord bots to make the server a bit more interesting.

## Functionalities 
List of functions the bot would do in the server:
- Give news on the weather and if the conditions are good for hiking or camping
- Give ideas of trails the group would like to do
- Give pictures with explanations of random great trails (in a selected area, like a news article)
- Keep track of the trails the group has done 
- Have a level bar for each completed trail by the group or individually (it can be a nice competitive aspect to have)
- Compare two trails and give its opinion on which one is better based on weather and etc
- Update the server on the newest camping or hiking gear

**Note** : This project is still a work in progress. The functionnalities might change or new ones might be added. 

### Coding

The project will be using Python and Java.
